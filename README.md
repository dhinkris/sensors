# BioSensors
Biosensors involves with the study of an anlytical device used for detection of a biological analyte which will be found in the bodily fluids like Blood, Urine, Saliva, etc. 

# Sensors Under study are:
1. Blood Glucose Sensor - Blood glucose monitoring is a way of testing the concentration of glucose in the blood (glycemia). 
2. Pregnancy Test Kit (Digital / Analog) - Sensor used to detect to check for pregnancy
3. Ovulation Test Kit - Ovulation prediction kits are usually antibody tests for luteinising hormone, which peaks in urine around the time of ovulation. More sophisticated tests, such as the Clearblue fertility monitor, also test for estradiol.
4. Ketone Sensor Strip - Detects the level of Ketone in urine to detect Diabetes 1 or 2

# Types of BioSensor under study
1. Potentiometric BioSensors
2. Acoustic Wave BioSensors
3. Electro-Chemical BioSensors
4. Amperometric BioSensors
5. Optical BioSensors
6. Colorometric BioSensors
